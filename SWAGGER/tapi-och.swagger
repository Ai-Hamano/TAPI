It associates to 2 or more FcPorts each playing the role of a Protection Unit. \nOne or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, FcPorts provide protection for one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) FcPorts where either protection or working can feed one or more protected FcPort.\nThe switch may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive mode it may define a waitToRestore time.\nIt may be used in one of several modes including source switch, destination switched, source and destination switched etc (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).\nIt may be locked out (prevented from switching), force switched or manual switched.\nIt will indicate switch state and change of state.\nThe switch can be switched away from all sources such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all sources (is 'open').\nThe ability for a Switch to be 'high impedance' allows bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the same bidirectional LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.\nThis ability allows multiple alternate routes to be present that otherwise would be in conflict.",
