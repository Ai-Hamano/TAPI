When LinkType is CWDM, the integer represents the nominal central wavelength in unit of pm (picometer). When LinkType is NO_WDM, the Integer field is null. For frequency and wavelength, the value shall be within the range of the maximum and minimum central frequencies or wavelengths specified for the corresponding application code used at the OCh Trail Termination.\nThis attribute is required for the OCh Trial Termination Point Source at the transmitter.  For the OCh Trail Termination Point Sink at the receiver, this attribute may not be needed since the receiver is required to operate at any frequency/wavelength between the maximum and minimum range for the standard application code.\n",
